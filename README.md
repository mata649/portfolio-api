# portfolio-api

The Portfolio API is a backend component of a portfolio website that was developed using Typescript, Express.js, MongoDB, and Clean Architecture principles. The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for handling sessions securely, ensuring that user data is protected.  The Clean Architecture principles make sure that the codebase is modular, maintainable, and testable, allowing for easy additions, bug fixes, and changes without breaking existing functionality. 

## Generics
Generics are a way to write code that can work with different types of data. They allow you to write code that is more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain. Instead of writing separate code for each specific data type, you can use generics to write code that can work with any data type.

I learned about generics when I was creating this project so I tried to use it to abstract a big part of the code. This helped me to write a reusable code and easy to extend, a good example of this in the implementation of [SkillMongoRepository](https://github.com/mata649/portfolio-api/blob/master/src/skill/data/mongo/skill.repository.ts) which extends of BaseMongoRepository inheriting all the base functions for a mongo repository (create, getById, get, update, delete) but extending a new function which is getSkillsByCategory. 

Another example is the implementation of [CategoryUseCase](https://github.com/mata649/portfolio-api/blob/master/src/category/domain/category.useCases.ts), I only have to extends the BaseUseCase to have a functional CategoryUseCase, avoiding to write repetitive code. This approach was gotten for most of the important code of the Back-End like controllers, repositories, useCases, requests, etc. You can find all the base code in the [base](https://github.com/mata649/portfolio-api/tree/master/src/base) directory to see all the abstractions to the code.  

The rest of the code mostly implements these base abstractions, so it was really easy to write new modules to the API based on these abstractions. I just needed to do sometimes some extension of the code depending on the needs of each module
## Requirements
